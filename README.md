## How the app is arranged

- lib is where the code sits
- main.dart is the init point
- stack.dart is used to keep page history
- common/ is where common stateless components can be found (and reused)
- pages/ is where all the widgets that form a page will sit. Any form of code that requires page level adjustments will be managed here
- pages/components are widgets that are in pages and will exists only as such
